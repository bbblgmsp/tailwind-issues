I'm encountering issues with tailwind css
I installed tailwind via console
I think in the end I had no more errors or warnings
but the tailwin css classes won't apply
Right now, there's only one file that uses a tailwind css class, that's the home.php
the tailwind.css file is loaded though.
thanks foe help
